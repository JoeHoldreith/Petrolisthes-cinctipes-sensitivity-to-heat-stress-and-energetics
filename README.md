# Petrolisthes-cinctipes-sensitivity-to-heat-stress-and-energetics
Here is a repository of R scripts and Fiji by imageJ macros used in the paper "Thermal Acclimatization of Developmental Energetics and Sensitivity to Heat Stress in Embryos of the Porcelain Crab Petrolisthes cinctipes" by Joe Holdreith, Jonathon Stillman, and Alexis Hooper. 

R scripts are accomponied by their respective workspaces as Rdata files. Scripts include raw data quality control, yolk consumption and growth rate calculation, ANOVA tests, and plot making. The raw data files, quality controled data file, and calculated rates used in the scripts are posted here as well. 

Fiji macros make use of the "Biomedgroup" (Credit to Thorsten Wagner: https://imagej.net/people/thorstenwagner) package for Fiji by ImageJ (https://sites.imagej.net/Biomedgroup/) . Please install the package before running the macros. Please use the link provided in our paper to download the photographs of Petrolisthes cinctipes embryos compatible with the macro.
